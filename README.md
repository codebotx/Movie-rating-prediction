Classifying mnist digit dataset using a trained Convolutional Neural Network using keras to classify the handwritten digits(0-9)
•	Trained a Convolutional Neural Network using keras to classify the handwritten digits(0-9)
•	Used Max Pooling to further enhance the perception of every ﬁlter. Made use of the dropout technique to reduce overﬁtting and to increase the accuracy
•	Technologies:Keras, Google Colab
